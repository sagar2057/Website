        Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet(World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).Here, I am describing briefly about the webpage development and designing. <br /><br /> Mainly, HTML(HyperText Markup Language), CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript are used for web development.<br /><br /> </p>
        
        <h2>HTML (HyperText Transfer Protocol)</h2>
        
        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p><b>HTML</b> or “Hypertext Markup Language,” is a code used to build web pages and web applications accessed on the internet. The code was developed at the dawn of the World Wide Web in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The language allows website creators to tell an internet browser how to display elements like images, text, forms, and interactive features.

Website creators routinely use HTML alongside Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, which are two other programming languages, to create sites and applications that users can access using internet browser programs like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Standards for HTML, as well as CSS, have been historically maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>

<h3>The History of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</h3>
<p>It was in 1980 that Tim Berners-Lee, while working for the European Organization for Nuclear Research, began working on a prototype to HTML. By the end of the decade, Berners-Lee would create the now-ubiquitous language, as well as an internet browser and server software.

Over the next two decades, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) would continue development on an international standard for the code. In 1995, the second version of HTML was published, and several additional updates would follow over the next several years.</p><p>This is an example of a simple HTML code:</p><br /><br />
            
            <img src = https://i.postimg.cc/6QnBRNf5/htmli.png><br /><br />
            
            <p>It only defines a title (will be displayed in the browser tab), a heading line, and a paragraph.<br /><br />
            
            Output is as follows : </p><br /><br />
            
            <img src = https://i.postimg.cc/mZq6xFGJ/htmlo.png ><br /><br />
            
            <p>The output doesn't look good,does it? It is because all the contents are in default. So CSS can be used to make it more attractive.<br /></p>
            
        <h2>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
        
        <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
        <p><b>CSS</b> or "Cascading Style Sheets" is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.

CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.

CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.</p>
        <h3>History of CSS : </h3>
              <p>CSS was first proposed by Hakon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee (father of Html) at CERN. The European Organization for Nuclear Research is known as CERN. Hakon wium lie is know as father of css.

CSS was proposed in 1994 as a web styling language, to solve some of the problems of Html 4. There were other styling languages proposed at this time, such as Style Sheets for Html and JSSS but CSS won.</p>

           <p> Output is as follows : </p><br /><br />
            
            <img src = https://i.postimg.cc/cLZRPfFs/csso.png width = 400px><br /><br />
            
            <p>This is a little better than the previous one even it's not the best. There are many other properties that makes it look even more better.</p>
            
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        
        <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
             <p><b>JavaScript</b>often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). However, the language itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) provides those APIs.

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in server-side website deployments, usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.</p>
        <h3>History of JavaScript : </h3>
        <p>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. It was inspired by Java, Scheme and Self. Netscape, for a time, made the best browser in the world and enjoyed market dominance.</p>
